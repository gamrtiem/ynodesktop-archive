A desktop client for [Yume Nikki Online](https://ynoproject.net/) with Discord Rich Presence. Show your friends what game you're playing and what room you're in. Also looks pretty cool as an installed program.

  

Created as a simple Electron wrapper around the website, with `discord-rpc` and some hacks to make save exporting/importing work.

  

## Features

- Display your game status and room information to friends on Discord.

- Easy installation and setup.

- Smooth integration with Yume Nikki Online.
